# GrayscaleDetector
Simple script that locates grayscale images in a folder and moves them to another folder

## How it works
Takes the image and resizes it to one pixel using PIL. If all three values of the color are equal then it is grayscale.

## Installation 
[Download](https://github.com/Brianto2/GrayscaleDetector/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and unzip the file
## Usage
* Run BW Detect.exe
